# Mermaid Magic

Visual Mermaid editor for VS Code with Lucid CSV export.

**What you can do**
- Build diagrams visually with nodes, edges, and labels.
- Edit Mermaid text side-by-side and keep it in sync.
- Export to Mermaid or Lucid CSV.
- Open and edit any `.mmd` or `.mermaid` file in your workspace.

**Get Started**
1. Open the Mermaid Magic view from the Activity Bar.
2. Select a Mermaid file from the list, or create a new diagram in the editor.
3. Use the side pane to edit nodes, edges, arrows, colors, and labels.
4. Use the Mermaid text drawer to edit raw Mermaid and click **Apply Text**.

**Editing Basics**
- Click a node to select it. Shift/Ctrl-click to select multiple nodes.
- Drag nodes to move them. Use middle mouse to pan the canvas.
- Drag from the small side handles on a node to create a new edge.
- Edge labels appear in the editor and export.

**Export**
- `Mermaid Magic: Export Mermaid` saves Mermaid text.
- `Mermaid Magic: Export Lucid CSV` exports a Lucid-compatible CSV.

**Supported Diagram Types**
- Flowchart
- Sequence Diagram
- Gantt
- Pie
- User Journey

**Tips**
- If you edit Mermaid text directly, include the `%% mermaid-magic` marker so imports round-trip cleanly.
- When multiple nodes are selected, the side pane shows shared shape, fill, and stroke options.

If you want support for additional Mermaid diagram types or export formats, open an issue on the project repository.
